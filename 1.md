I wanted to write about self-respect first. Partly because Joan Didion had done it. Also, because the borders I try to cross can't be crossed without credentials. Because there seems to be a distance between my greatest self and the nigga I see in the Mirror.
The first time i felt a lack of self respect I couldn't even name what I was feeling. The kids i hung around had given me the impression that I was fairly smart --of course they were far from Einstein and I was just slightly less far. So it came to me as a shock--on the final day of the semester--when they had called fourth a pretty girl as class topper. It was supposed to be me. That's what I thought. 
That day i felt the distance between who I thought i was and what the world had declared me. I was not by any fair measure who I thought I was. I caved. Quietly. I let the world tell me who I was. A silent betrayal of my own vision. A slight death. Every inch of pride I had was slowly distilled by the daily weight of walking a path I never endorsed.
I realized then--like a stripper walking outside at 3.00AM without a coat, that, I did not respect myself. That realization is its own kind of loss. A loss of innocence. Because at that moment I knew three new parts to the life i was living: Who i was, who i wanted to be and what the world had declared me to be. 
The second time wasn't dramatic. It wasn't about a loss of opportunity or recognition. I wasn't trying to open a door, I was closing it and in the process i had broken it. I was of course with the squad. They were speaking against a girl I clearly liked. They didn't know that. 
I shrank. Words flew. Ugly ones. I saw them almost pass through me and stop somewhere near my heart. One of them caught a sentence mid air, held it up and asked me, "Jehu, you know this girl right?"
It's always easier to walk a road that's already been paved. That's what roads are for. Most men follow the path. But as you follow the script of behavior given. The self you aspire to be stands behind your eyes and watches. Watches you do what you never meant to do. Every decision, every motion, runs through that filter. Compliments don’t pass. High fives don’t reach it. Every move is sent backward, to be judged by a self you barely acknowledge but can’t escape.
The dismal part of lacking self-respect is that the suffering is internal, but the benefits—the praise, the comfort, the approval—are external. That’s the paradox. The human experience values its own subjective reference point over all others. But in this specific situation the priority changes, the respect for that subjective point of reference is perverted. One goes outside. The problem is, even when you put the world first, your mind still answers to something else. And when those two truths clash—what you are and what you perform—you find yourself embarrassed by your own style. You find yourself without self-respect.
You feel it in moments. Not because they matter in the grand scheme, but because they linger. Longer than they should. Because only you know what they cost.
The 100th time i felt a lack of self respect, I realized its importance. That time when i felt lack, i was disrespecting a girl. Like most pretty girls about to open up, she had overstepped. And to put it simply, I was teaching her on the importance of stepping back. Breathe. But the truth is, I wasn't teaching her anything-I was proving something to myself. That my kin didn't know how to let someone close without turning it into a test. That the void of self respect had become etched into my thinking, I had learned to mirror it. That what is called boundaries could be barriers. At defense of a fragile scaffolding of aa self that hadn't yet learned to be whole. 
That's what self-respect demands not just posture, but posture without pretense. Not performance but presence. A mild conviction to not demand praise, to not constantly push to feel in control. And maybe, most of all, self-respect means not mistaking self-defense for self definition
