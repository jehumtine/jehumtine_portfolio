Scarcity is a feeling. Scarcity is also a philosophy. I want to make a point, a point I think hasn't before been made. Sociologists draw graphs, Politicians continue to ban banning, Pastors double speak. But a body shaking at 4AM doesn't move according to theory or policy. It follows scarcity.  










I want to make a point, a point I think hasn't before been made. A boy with empty hands has to hold on but that doesn't mean society should stop the drug induced from thriving. I want to make a strong point on addiction, about how its not only about the sociology of the addict. Its not also only about the metaphysics, his ethics, or his personal philosophy, Its about how all those factors blend together to direct scarcity.  
Sociologists draw graphs. But a body shaking at 4AM doesn’t move according to theory. It moves according to ache.
What if he wants language for the ache, not a twelve-step script? What if he’s not failing, but speaking a dialect we’ve forgotten how to hear?
