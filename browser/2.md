I dreamed I was in a cave with one of my plugs. It was dark, but a kind of light seeped through—enough to make my eyes fall for the illusion of brightness. I was thirsty. He sat on his bunk bed, eyes locked on the dark, which was also the light. I took one of his water jugs without asking. Drank fast. He didn’t move. Still thirsty, I tapped his shoulder. Reached for the jug again. His eyes met mine, sharp and still.  
“That water is dirty,” he said. “I spat in it.”
My mother once told me about improvisation. She said it is not allowed. She told me that scripts and sermons is what Jesus Christ had lived by and so should I. But in between the lines of those sentences, I saw her narrative break down. He pointed at the jug that was behind me and said to drink that water. That one was clean. Still piercing my eyes, I had drank the water from the first jug and felt nothing wrong with it. There was nothing wrong with the water I had drank it and nothing was wrong. Still piercing my eyes. This was a confrontation. He was asking me, do you believe yourself more than you believe me. Improvisation. Is what you do when the universe arrives first. When you’re not the author but the reader, reading a sentence someone had already written. 
Do you gaze back? 
Do you break the line?
Do you improvise? 
The cave was his room. It was also not. Small and wide. Bright and dark. He was above me. I was lying down. He was above me. I was lying down.
There was nothing wrong with the water.
But something had changed anyway.
My mother once taught me about Jesus Christ, about seeping into you weren't meant to be.About writing sentences. About asking, _Now that this is the state of the universe—what do I do?_  
Do I believe me more than I believe him?

I don’t know what happened next.  
I was still. Not because the water was dirty, but because I had drunk it.  
Because he let me drink it.

That’s what stayed with me: not the dirt, but the permission withheld.  
He wanted it to be his to give. The power in the giving.

But Christ once entered the temple and said they were wrong
